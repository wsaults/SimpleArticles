# SimpleArticles

## Goal
Take a simple view controller called `ArticlesViewController` and apply mock PR changes to it.

ie:
- Fix nits
- Add unit tests (use dependency injection and test doubles to make this possible)
- Check for memory leaks using unit test helpers
- Fix any compiler issues `self?.articles = articles`
- Use codable for model objects that would encode/decode json data
